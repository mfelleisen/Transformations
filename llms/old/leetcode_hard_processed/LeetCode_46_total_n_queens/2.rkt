;; Function to count the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
;; The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
;; Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to theÂ n-queens puzzle.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: n = 4
;; Output: 2
;; Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: n = 1
;; Output: 1
;; Constraints:
;; 1 <= n <= 9
