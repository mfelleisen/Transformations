                (loop (+ i 1)))))))) ; else, check next column

;; The main backtracking function to count the solutions
(define (backtrack n cols)
  (if (= (length cols) n)
      1 ; if all queens are placed, count as one solution
      (let loop ((i 0) (count 0))
        (if (= i n)

                  (loop (+ i 1) (+ count (backtrack n new-cols)))) ; and continue

;; The main function to start the process
;; The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
;; Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to theÂ n-queens puzzle.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: n = 4
;; Output: 2
;; Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: n = 1
;; Output: 1
;; Constraints:
;; 1 <= n <= 9
(define (total_n_queens n)
  (backtrack n '())) ; start with an empty list for columns

;; The defined functions adhere to idiomatic Racket standards, utilizing recursion and conditionals in a manner consistent with functional programming paradigms. The solution efficiently explores all possible board configurations, leveraging the backtrack function to navigate through the solution space and employing the is-safe function to ensure that each queen placed does not threaten any previously placed queen, thus ensuring a valid configuration.
