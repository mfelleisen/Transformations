;; You have n super washing machines on a line. Initially, each washing machine has some dresses or is empty.
;; For each move, you could choose any m (1 <= m <= n) washing machines, and pass one dress of each washing machine to one of its adjacent washing machines at the same time.
;; Given an integer list machines representing the number of dresses in each washing machine from left to right on the line, return the minimum number of moves to make all the washing machines have the same number of dresses. If it is not possible to do it, return -1.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: machines = [1,0,5]
;; Output: 3
;; Explanation:
;; 1st move:    1     0 <-- 5    =>    1     1     4
;; 2nd move:    1 <-- 1 <-- 4    =>    2     1     3
;; 3rd move:    2     1 <-- 3    =>    2     2     2
;; Example 2:
;; Input: machines = [0,3,0]
;; Output: 2
;; Explanation:
;; 1st move:    0 <-- 3     0    =>    1     2     0
;; 2nd move:    1     2 --> 0    =>    1     1     1
;; Example 3:
;; Input: machines = [0,2,0]
;; Output: -1
;; Explanation:
;; It's impossible to make all three washing machines have the same number of dresses.
;; Constraints:
;; n == machines.length
;; 1 <= n <= 104
;; 0 <= machines[i] <= 105

;; The function `find_min_moves` first checks if it is possible to evenly distribute dresses among all machines.
;; If not possible, it immediately returns -1.
;; Otherwise, it iterates through each machine, updating the current imbalance and calculating the necessary moves.
;; The foldl function is used to accumulate both the current imbalance and the maximum number of moves required.
;; Finally, it returns the maximum number of moves required to achieve the goal.
