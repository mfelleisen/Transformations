;; You are given a 0-indexed list of unique strings words.
;; A palindrome pair is a pair of integers (i, j) such that:
;; 0 <= i, j < words.length,
;; i != j, and
;; words[i] + words[j] (the concatenation of the two strings) is a palindrome.
;; Return a list of all the palindrome pairs of words.
;; You must write an algorithm withÂ O(sum of words[i].length)Â runtime complexity.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: words = ["abcd","dcba","lls","s","sssll"]
;; Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,2],[2,4]]
;; Explanation: The palindromes are ["abcddcba","dcbaabcd","slls","llssssll"]
;; Example 2:
;; Input: words = ["bat","tab","cat"]
;; Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
;; Explanation: The palindromes are ["battab","tabbat"]
;; Example 3:
;; Input: words = ["a",""]
;; Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
;; Explanation: The palindromes are ["a","a"]
;; Constraints:
;; 1 <= words.length <= 5000
;; 0 <= words[i].length <= 300
;; words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
