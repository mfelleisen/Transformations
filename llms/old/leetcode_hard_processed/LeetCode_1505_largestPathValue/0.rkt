;; There is a directed graph of n colored nodes and m edges. The nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1.
;; You are given a string colors where colors[i] is a lowercase English letter representing the color of the ith node in this graph (0-indexed). You are also given a 2D list edges where edges[j] = [aj, bj] indicates that there is a directed edge from node aj to node bj.
;; A valid path in the graph is a sequence of nodes x1 -> x2 -> x3 -> ... -> xk such that there is a directed edge from xi to xi+1 for every 1 <= i < k. The color value of the path is the number of nodes that are colored the most frequently occurring color along that path.
;; Return the largest color value of any valid path in the given graph, or -1 if the graph contains a cycle.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: colors = "abaca", edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
;; Output: 3
;; Explanation: The path 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 contains 3 nodes that are colored "a" (red in the above image).
;; Example 2:
;; Input: colors = "a", edges = [[0,0]]
;; Output: -1
;; Explanation: There is a cycle from 0 to 0.
;; Constraints:
;; n == colors.length
;; m == edges.length
;; 1 <= n <= 105
;; 0 <= m <= 105
;; colors consists of lowercase English letters.
;; 0 <= aj, bjÂ < n
