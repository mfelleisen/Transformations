;; A positive integer is magical if it is divisible by either a or b.
;; Given the three integers n, a, and b, return the nth magical number. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: n = 1, a = 2, b = 3
;; Output: 2
;; Example 2:
;; Input: n = 4, a = 2, b = 3
;; Output: 6
;; Constraints:
;; 1 <= n <= 109
;; 2 <= a, b <= 4 * 104
