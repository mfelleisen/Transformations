;; The set [1, 2, 3, ...,Â n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
;; By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:
;; "123"
;; "132"
;; "213"
;; "231"
;; "312"
;; "321"
;; Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: n = 3, k = 3
;; Output: "213"
;; Example 2:
;; Input: n = 4, k = 9
;; Output: "2314"
;; Example 3:
;; Input: n = 3, k = 1
;; Output: "123"
;; Constraints:
;; 1 <= n <= 9
;; 1 <= k <= n!
