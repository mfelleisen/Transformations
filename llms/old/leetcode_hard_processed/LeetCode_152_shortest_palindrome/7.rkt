;; You are given a string s. You can convert s to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it.
;; Return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: s = "aacecaaa"
;; Output: "aaacecaaa"
;; Example 2:
;; Input: s = "abcd"
;; Output: "dcbabcd"
;; Constraints:
;; 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
;; s consists of lowercase English letters only.
(define (shortest_palindrome s)
  ;; Calculate the length of the input string.
  (define n (string-length s))
  ;; Reverse the input string.
  (define rev_s (list->string (reverse (string->list s))))

  ;; Define a helper function to check for the shortest palindrome.
  ;; It tries to match the substring of 's' from the start to 'n - i' 
  ;; with the substring of 'rev_s' from 'i' to the end.
  ;; If a match is found, it constructs the palindrome by prefixing the 
  ;; non-matching part of 'rev_s' to 's'.

            (check (add1 i)))))

  ;; Start the check from the beginning of the string.
