;; Define the function shortest_palindrome that takes a string s
;; You are given a string s. You can convert s to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it.
;; Return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: s = "aacecaaa"
;; Output: "aaacecaaa"
;; Example 2:
;; Input: s = "abcd"
;; Output: "dcbabcd"
;; Constraints:
;; 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
;; s consists of lowercase English letters only.
(define (shortest_palindrome s)
  ;; Get the length of the string s
  (define n (string-length s))
  ;; Reverse the string s
  (define rev_s (list->string (reverse (string->list s))))
  ;; Define a loop to find the shortest palindrome by adding characters in front of s
  (define (loop i)
    ;; Check if the substring of s from start to n-i is equal to the substring of rev_s from i to end
    ;; If it is, then concatenate the substring of rev_s from start to i with s to form the palindrome
    (if (string=? (substring s 0 (- n i)) (substring rev_s i))
        (string-append (substring rev_s 0 i) s)
        ;; If not, recursively call loop with i incremented by 1
        (loop (+ i 1))))
  ;; Start the loop with i = 0
  (loop 0))

;; Example usage:
;; (shortest_palindrome "aacecaaa") ; should return "aaacecaaa"
;; (shortest_palindrome "abcd") ; should return "dcbabcd"
