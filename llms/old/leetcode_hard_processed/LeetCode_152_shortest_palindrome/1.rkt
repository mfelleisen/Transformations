;; You are given a string s. You can convert s to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it.
;; Return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: s = "aacecaaa"
;; Output: "aaacecaaa"
;; Example 2:
;; Input: s = "abcd"
;; Output: "dcbabcd"
;; Constraints:
;; 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
;; s consists of lowercase English letters only.
