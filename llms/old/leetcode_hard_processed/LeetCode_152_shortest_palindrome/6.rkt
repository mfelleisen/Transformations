;; You are given a string s. You can convert s to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it.
;; Return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: s = "aacecaaa"
;; Output: "aaacecaaa"
;; Example 2:
;; Input: s = "abcd"
;; Output: "dcbabcd"
;; Constraints:
;; 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
;; s consists of lowercase English letters only.

  (define s-list (string->list s))
  ;; Reverse the list of characters to compare with the original
  (define rev-s-list (reverse s-list))
  
  ;; Helper function to check if the front part of the original list matches
  ;; with the corresponding part of the reversed list.
  (define (is-palindrome-prefix? len)

  ;; Main loop that tries to find the smallest prefix that forms a palindrome
  ;; when the reversed suffix is added in front of the original string.
  (define (loop i)
