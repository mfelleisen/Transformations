;; Given n orders, each order consist in pickup and delivery services. 
;; Count all valid pickup/delivery possible sequences such that delivery(i) is always after of pickup(i). 
;; Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: n = 1
;; Output: 1
;; Explanation: Unique order (P1, D1), Delivery 1 always is after of Pickup 1.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: n = 2
;; Output: 6
;; Explanation: All possible orders: 
;; (P1,P2,D1,D2), (P1,P2,D2,D1), (P1,D1,P2,D2), (P2,P1,D1,D2), (P2,P1,D2,D1) and (P2,D2,P1,D1).
;; This is an invalid order (P1,D2,P2,D1) because Pickup 2 is after of Delivery 2.
;; Example 3:
;; Input: n = 3
;; Output: 90
;; Constraints:
;; 1 <= n <= 500
(define (countOrders n)
  ;; Define the modulo constant as per the problem statement.

        ;; Otherwise, calculate the next term in the sequence and recurse.
        (loop (add1 i) (modulo (* ans (* (sub1 (* 2 i)) i)) MOD)))))

;; The function counts all valid sequences of pickup and delivery orders,
;; ensuring that each delivery follows its corresponding pickup.
;; It uses a loop with a tail recursive structure for efficient computation.
;; Modulo is applied at each step to keep the result within bounds.
