;; Given n orders, each order consist in pickup and delivery services. 
;; Count all valid pickup/delivery possible sequences such that delivery(i) is always after of pickup(i). 
;; Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: n = 1
;; Output: 1
;; Explanation: Unique order (P1, D1), Delivery 1 always is after of Pickup 1.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: n = 2
;; Output: 6
;; Explanation: All possible orders: 
;; (P1,P2,D1,D2), (P1,P2,D2,D1), (P1,D1,P2,D2), (P2,P1,D1,D2), (P2,P1,D2,D1) and (P2,D2,P1,D1).
;; This is an invalid order (P1,D2,P2,D1) because Pickup 2 is after of Delivery 2.
;; Example 3:
;; Input: n = 3
;; Output: 90
;; Constraints:
;; 1 <= n <= 500
(define (countOrders n)
  ;; Define the modulus constant as specified in the problem statement
  (define MOD 1000000007)
  ;; Start with an initial answer of 1 to maintain the product calculation
  (define ans 1)
  ;; Loop through each order from 1 to n
  (for ([i (in-range 1 (add1 n))])
    ;; For each i, multiply the current ans by (2*i - 1)*i
    ;; Use modulo to keep the result within the MOD limit
    (set! ans (modulo (* ans (modulo (* (sub1 (* 2 i)) i) MOD)) MOD)))
  ;; Return the final answer
  ans)

;; The function countOrders calculates the number of valid pickup and delivery sequences
;; for n orders, ensuring delivery of each order follows its pickup, and returns the count modulo 10^9 + 7.
