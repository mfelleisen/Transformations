;; Given n orders, each order consist in pickup and delivery services. 
;; Count all valid pickup/delivery possible sequences such that delivery(i) is always after of pickup(i). 
;; Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: n = 1
;; Output: 1
;; Explanation: Unique order (P1, D1), Delivery 1 always is after of Pickup 1.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: n = 2
;; Output: 6
;; Explanation: All possible orders: 
;; (P1,P2,D1,D2), (P1,P2,D2,D1), (P1,D1,P2,D2), (P2,P1,D1,D2), (P2,P1,D2,D1) and (P2,D2,P1,D1).
;; This is an invalid order (P1,D2,P2,D1) because Pickup 2 is after of Delivery 2.
;; Example 3:
;; Input: n = 3
;; Output: 90
;; Constraints:
;; 1 <= n <= 500
