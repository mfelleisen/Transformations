;; Given a string s, return the last substring of s in lexicographical order.
;; Given a string s, return the last substring of s in lexicographical order.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: s = "abab"
;; Output: "bab"
;; Explanation: The substrings are ["a", "ab", "aba", "abab", "b", "ba", "bab"]. The lexicographically maximum substring is "bab".
;; Example 2:
;; Input: s = "leetcode"
;; Output: "tcode"
;; Constraints:
;; 1 <= s.length <= 4 * 105
;; s contains only lowercase English letters.
