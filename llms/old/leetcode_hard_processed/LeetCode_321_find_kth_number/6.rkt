;; Given two integers n and k, return the kth lexicographically smallest integer in the range [1, n].
;; Example 1:
;; Input: n = 13, k = 2
;; Output: 10
;; Explanation: The lexicographical order is [1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], so the second smallest number is 10.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: n = 1, k = 1
;; Output: 1
;; Constraints:
;; 1 <= k <= n <= 109
