;; Given two integers n and k, return the kth lexicographically smallest integer in the range [1, n].
;; Example 1:
;; Input: n = 13, k = 2
;; Output: 10
;; Explanation: The lexicographical order is [1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], so the second smallest number is 10.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: n = 1, k = 1
;; Output: 1
;; Constraints:
;; 1 <= k <= n <= 109
(define (find_kth_number n k)
  ;; Create a list from 1 to n
  (let ((nums (range 1 (add1 n))))
    ;; Sort the list lexicographically by converting numbers to strings
    (define sorted-nums (sort nums string<? #:key number->string))
    ;; Return the k-th element (subtract 1 because lists are 0-indexed)
    (list-ref sorted-nums (sub1 k))))

;; The `range` function generates a list of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive of 1, exclusive of n+1).
;; `sort` with `string<?` as the comparison function and `#:key number->string` sorts the numbers lexicographically.
;; `list-ref` is used to access the k-th element, adjusting for Racket's 0-based indexing by subtracting 1.
