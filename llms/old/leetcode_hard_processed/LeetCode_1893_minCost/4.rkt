;; Function to calculate the minimum total cost to make all elements in nums equal.
;; You are given two 0-indexed lists nums and cost consisting each of n positive integers.
;; You can do the following operation any number of times:
;; Increase or decrease any element of the list nums by 1.
;; The cost of doing one operation on the ith element is cost[i].
;; Return the minimum total cost such that all the elements of the list nums become equal.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: nums = [1,3,5,2], cost = [2,3,1,14]
;; Output: 8
;; Explanation: We can make all the elements equal to 2 in the following way:
;; - Increase the 0th element one time. The cost is 2.
;; - Decrease the 1st element one time. The cost is 3.
;; - Decrease the 2nd element three times. The cost is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
;; The total cost is 2 + 3 + 3 = 8.
;; It can be shown that we cannot make the list equal with a smaller cost.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], cost = [4,2,8,1,3]
;; Output: 0
;; Explanation: All the elements are already equal, so no operations are needed.
;; Constraints:
;; n == nums.length == cost.length
;; 1 <= n <= 105
;; 1 <= nums[i], cost[i] <= 106
;; Test cases are generated in a way that the output doesn't exceedÂ 253-1

;; The function takes two lists, nums and cost, and computes the minimum cost required
;; to make all elements in nums equal. It does so by checking the cost for making all
;; elements equal to either the minimum element in nums or the minimum element plus one,
;; since these are the only candidates that need to be checked for the optimal solution.
;; The cost for each element is calculated by multiplying the difference from the target
;; by the operation cost, and the total cost is the sum of these individual costs.
;; The minimum of these total costs is returned as the answer.
