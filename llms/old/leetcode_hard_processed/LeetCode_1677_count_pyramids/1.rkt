;; Function to count the total number of pyramidal and inverse pyramidal plots in a grid
;; A farmer has a rectangular grid of land with m rows and n columns that can be divided into unit cells. Each cell is either fertile (represented by a 1) or barren (represented by a 0). All cells outside the grid are considered barren.
;; A rktramidal plot of land can be defined as a set of cells with the following criteria:
;; The number of cells in the set has to be greater than 1 and all cells must be fertile.
;; The apex of a rktramid is the topmost cell of the rktramid. The height of a rktramid is the number of rows it covers. Let (r, c) be the apex of the rktramid, and its height be h. Then, the plot comprises of cells (i, j) where r <= i <= r + h - 1 and c - (i - r) <= j <= c + (i - r).
;; An inverse rktramidal plot of land can be defined as a set of cells with similar criteria:
;; The number of cells in the set has to be greater than 1 and all cells must be fertile.
;; The apex of an inverse rktramid is the bottommost cell of the inverse rktramid. The height of an inverse rktramid is the number of rows it covers. Let (r, c) be the apex of the rktramid, and its height be h. Then, the plot comprises of cells (i, j) where r - h + 1 <= i <= r and c - (r - i) <= j <= c + (r - i).
;; Some examples of valid and invalid rktramidal (and inverse rktramidal) plots are shown below. Black cells indicate fertile cells.
;; Given a 0-indexed m x n binary matrix grid representing the farmland, return the total number of rktramidal and inverse rktramidal plots that can be found in grid.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0],[1,1,1,1]]
;; Output: 2
;; Explanation: The 2 possible rktramidal plots are shown in blue and red respectively.
;; There are no inverse rktramidal plots in this grid. 
;; Hence total number of rktramidal and inverse rktramidal plots is 2 + 0 = 2.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]
;; Output: 2
;; Explanation: The rktramidal plot is shown in blue, and the inverse rktramidal plot is shown in red. 
;; Hence the total number of plots is 1 + 1 = 2.
;; Example 3:
;; Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[0,1,0,0,1]]
;; Output: 13
;; Explanation: There are 7 rktramidal plots, 3 of which are shown in the 2nd and 3rd figures.
;; There are 6 inverse rktramidal plots, 2 of which are shown in the last figure.
;; The total number of plots is 7 + 6 = 13.
;; Constraints:
;; m == grid.length
;; n == grid[i].length
;; 1 <= m, n <= 1000
;; 1 <= m * n <= 105
;; grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

;; The provided Python code doesn't directly translate to identifying pyramidal or inverse pyramidal plots based on the problem description. 
;; It seems to attempt a simplified calculation that doesn't align with the specified criteria for pyramidal plots. 
;; For an idiomatic Racket solution that accurately counts such plots, a more complex approach involving dynamic programming or exhaustive search would be required.
;; The provided translation follows the Python logic but may not accurately solve the described problem.
