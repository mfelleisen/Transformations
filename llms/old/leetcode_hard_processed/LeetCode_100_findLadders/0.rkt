;; A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a hash wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:
;; Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
;; Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
;; sk == endWord
;; Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a hash wordList, return all the shortest transformation sequences from beginWord to endWord, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words [beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk].
;; Example 1:
;; Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
;; Output: [["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]]
;; Explanation:Â There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
;; "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"
;; "hit" -> "hot" -> "lot" -> "log" -> "cog"
;; Example 2:
;; Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
;; Output: []
;; Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
;; Constraints:
;; 1 <= beginWord.length <= 5
;; endWord.length == beginWord.length
;; 1 <= wordList.length <= 500
;; wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
;; beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
;; beginWord != endWord
;; All the words in wordList are unique.
;; The sum of all shortest transformation sequences does not exceed 105.
