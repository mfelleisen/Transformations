;; Function to calculate the minimum total cost to make all elements equal
;; You are given two 0-indexed lists nums and cost consisting each of n positive integers.
;; You can do the following operation any number of times:
;; Increase or decrease any element of the list nums by 1.
;; The cost of doing one operation on the ith element is cost[i].
;; Return the minimum total cost such that all the elements of the list nums become equal.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: nums = [1,3,5,2], cost = [2,3,1,14]
;; Output: 8
;; Explanation: We can make all the elements equal to 2 in the following way:
;; - Increase the 0th element one time. The cost is 2.
;; - Decrease the 1st element one time. The cost is 3.
;; - Decrease the 2nd element three times. The cost is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
;; The total cost is 2 + 3 + 3 = 8.
;; It can be shown that we cannot make the list equal with a smaller cost.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], cost = [4,2,8,1,3]
;; Output: 0
;; Explanation: All the elements are already equal, so no operations are needed.
;; Constraints:
;; n == nums.length == cost.length
;; 1 <= n <= 105
;; 1 <= nums[i], cost[i] <= 106
;; Test cases are generated in a way that the output doesn't exceed 253-1

    ans))

;; The function first calculates the base, which is the minimum number in the `nums` list.
;; It then loops through two possible targets (the base and base + 1) to find which target minimizes the total cost.
;; The total cost for each target is calculated by summing the absolute difference between each element in `nums`
;; and the target, multiplied by the corresponding cost in the `cost` list.
;; The minimum of these total costs is then returned as the answer.
