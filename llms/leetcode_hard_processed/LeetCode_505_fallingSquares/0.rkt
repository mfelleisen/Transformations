;; There are several squares being dropped onto the X-axis of a 2D plane.
;; You are given a 2D integer list positions where positions[i] = [lefti, sideLengthi] represents the ith square with a side length of sideLengthi that is dropped with its left edge aligned with X-coordinate lefti.
;; Each square is dropped one at a time from a height above any landed squares. It then falls downward (negative Y direction) until it either lands on the top side of another square or on the X-axis. A square brushing the left/right side of another square does not count as landing on it. Once it lands, it freezes in place and cannot be moved.
;; After each square is dropped, you must record the height of the current tallest stack of squares.
;; Return an integer list ans where ans[i] represents the height described above after dropping the ith square.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: positions = [[1,2],[2,3],[6,1]]
;; Output: [2,5,5]
;; Explanation:
;; After the first drop, the tallest stack is square 1 with a height of 2.
;; After the second drop, the tallest stack is squares 1 and 2 with a height of 5.
;; After the third drop, the tallest stack is still squares 1 and 2 with a height of 5.
;; Thus, we return an answer of [2, 5, 5].
;; Example 2:
;; Input: positions = [[100,100],[200,100]]
;; Output: [100,100]
;; Explanation:
;; After the first drop, the tallest stack is square 1 with a height of 100.
;; After the second drop, the tallest stack is either square 1 or square 2, both with heights of 100.
;; Thus, we return an answer of [100, 100].
;; Note that square 2 only brushes the right side of square 1, which does not count as landing on it.
;; Constraints:
;; 1 <= positions.length <= 1000
;; 1 <= lefti <= 108
;; 1 <= sideLengthi <= 106
