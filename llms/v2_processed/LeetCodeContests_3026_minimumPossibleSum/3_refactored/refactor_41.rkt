;; Define the function to calculate the minimum possible sum of a beautiful array.
;; You are given positive integers n and target.
;; An array nums is beautiful if it meets the following conditions:
;;  * nums.length == n.
;;  * nums consists of pairwise distinct positive integers.
;;  * There doesn't exist two distinct indices, i and j, in the range [0, n - 1], such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target.
;; Return the minimum possible sum that a beautiful array could have modulo 109 + 7.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: n = 2, target = 3
;; Output: 4
;; Explanation: We can see that nums = [1,3] is beautiful.
;; - The array nums has length n = 2.
;; - The array nums consists of pairwise distinct positive integers.
;; - There doesn't exist two distinct indices, i and j, with nums[i] + nums[j] == 3.
;; It can be proven that 4 is the minimum possible sum that a beautiful array could have.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: n = 3, target = 3
;; Output: 8
;; Explanation: We can see that nums = [1,3,4] is beautiful.
;; - The array nums has length n = 3.
;; - The array nums consists of pairwise distinct positive integers.
;; - There doesn't exist two distinct indices, i and j, with nums[i] + nums[j] == 3.
;; It can be proven that 8 is the minimum possible sum that a beautiful array could have.
;; Example 3:
;; Input: n = 1, target = 1
;; Output: 1
;; Explanation: We can see, that nums = [1] is beautiful.
;; Constraints:
;;  * 1 <= n <= 109
;;  * 1 <= target <= 109
