;; You are given a 0-indexed array nums of integers.
;; A triplet of indices (i, j, k) is a mountain if:
;;  * i < j < k
;;  * nums[i] < nums[j] and nums[k] < nums[j]
;; Return the minimum possible sum of a mountain triplet of nums. If no such triplet exists, return -1.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: nums = [8,6,1,5,3]
;; Output: 9
;; Explanation: Triplet (2, 3, 4) is a mountain triplet of sum 9 since:
;; - 2 < 3 < 4
;; - nums[2] < nums[3] and nums[4] < nums[3]
;; And the sum of this triplet is nums[2] + nums[3] + nums[4] = 9. It can be shown that there are no mountain triplets with a sum of less than 9.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: nums = [5,4,8,7,10,2]
;; Output: 13
;; Explanation: Triplet (1, 3, 5) is a mountain triplet of sum 13 since:
;; - 1 < 3 < 5
;; - nums[1] < nums[3] and nums[5] < nums[3]
;; And the sum of this triplet is nums[1] + nums[3] + nums[5] = 13. It can be shown that there are no mountain triplets with a sum of less than 13.
;; Example 3:
;; Input: nums = [6,5,4,3,4,5]
;; Output: -1
;; Explanation: It can be shown that there are no mountain triplets in nums.
;; Constraints:
;;  * 3 <= nums.length <= 50
;;  * 1 <= nums[i] <= 50
