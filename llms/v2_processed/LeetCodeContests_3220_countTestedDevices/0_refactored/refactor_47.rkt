;; You are given a 0-indexed integer array batteryPercentages having length n, denoting the battery percentages of n 0-indexed devices.
;; Your task is to test each device i in order from 0 to n - 1, by performing the following test operations:
;; If batteryPercentages[i] is greater than 0:
;; Increment the count of tested devices.
;; Decrease the battery percentage of all devices with indices j in the range [i + 1, n - 1] by 1, ensuring their battery percentage never goes below 0, i.e, batteryPercentages[j] = max(0, batteryPercentages[j] - 1).
;; Move to the next device.
;; Otherwise, move to the next device without performing any test.
;; Return an integer denoting the number of devices that will be tested after performing the test operations in order.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: batteryPercentages = [1,1,2,1,3]
;; Output: 3
;; Explanation: Performing the test operations in order starting from device 0:
;; At device 0, batteryPercentages[0] > 0, so there is now 1 tested device, and batteryPercentages becomes [1,0,1,0,2].
;; At device 1, batteryPercentages[1] == 0, so we move to the next device without testing.
;; At device 2, batteryPercentages[2] > 0, so there are now 2 tested devices, and batteryPercentages becomes [1,0,1,0,1].
;; At device 3, batteryPercentages[3] == 0, so we move to the next device without testing.
;; At device 4, batteryPercentages[4] > 0, so there are now 3 tested devices, and batteryPercentages stays the same.
;; So, the answer is 3.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: batteryPercentages = [0,1,2]
;; Output: 2
;; Explanation: Performing the test operations in order starting from device 0:
;; At device 0, batteryPercentages[0] == 0, so we move to the next device without testing.
;; At device 1, batteryPercentages[1] > 0, so there is now 1 tested device, and batteryPercentages becomes [0,1,1].
;; At device 2, batteryPercentages[2] > 0, so there are now 2 tested devices, and batteryPercentages stays the same.
;; So, the answer is 2.
;; Constraints:
;; 1 <= n == batteryPercentages.length <= 100 
;; 0 <= batteryPercentages[i] <= 100
