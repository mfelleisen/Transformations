;; You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k.
;; A subarray is called equal if all of its elements are equal. Note that the empty subarray is an equal subarray.
;; Return the length of the longest possible equal subarray after deleting at most k elements from nums.
;; A subarray is a contiguous, possibly empty sequence of elements within an array.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: nums = [1,3,2,3,1,3], k = 3
;; Output: 3
;; Explanation: It's optimal to delete the elements at index 2 and index 4.
;; After deleting them, nums becomes equal to [1, 3, 3, 3].
;; The longest equal subarray starts at i = 1 and ends at j = 3 with length equal to 3.
;; It can be proven that no longer equal subarrays can be created.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,1,1], k = 2
;; Output: 4
;; Explanation: It's optimal to delete the elements at index 2 and index 3.
;; After deleting them, nums becomes equal to [1, 1, 1, 1].
;; The array itself is an equal subarray, so the answer is 4.
;; It can be proven that no longer equal subarrays can be created.
;; Constraints:
;;  * 1 <= nums.length <= 105
;;  * 1 <= nums[i] <= nums.length
;;  * 0 <= k <= nums.length
