;; You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k.
;; A subarray is called equal if all of its elements are equal. Note that the empty subarray is an equal subarray.
;; Return the length of the longest possible equal subarray after deleting at most k elements from nums.
;; A subarray is a contiguous, possibly empty sequence of elements within an array.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: nums = [1,3,2,3,1,3], k = 3
;; Output: 3
;; Explanation: It's optimal to delete the elements at index 2 and index 4.
;; After deleting them, nums becomes equal to [1, 3, 3, 3].
;; The longest equal subarray starts at i = 1 and ends at j = 3 with length equal to 3.
;; It can be proven that no longer equal subarrays can be created.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,1,1], k = 2
;; Output: 4
;; Explanation: It's optimal to delete the elements at index 2 and index 3.
;; After deleting them, nums becomes equal to [1, 1, 1, 1].
;; The array itself is an equal subarray, so the answer is 4.
;; It can be proven that no longer equal subarrays can be created.
;; Constraints:
;;  * 1 <= nums.length <= 105
;;  * 1 <= nums[i] <= nums.length
;;  * 0 <= k <= nums.length

;; The refactored function `longestEqualSubarray` maintains the same behavior as the original function. 
;; It uses a helper function to implement the sliding window approach recursively. 
;; The helper function takes `nums`, `k`, `left`, `count`, `max-length`, and `right` as arguments and returns the maximum length found. 
;; The base case of the recursion occurs when `right` exceeds the length of `nums`. 
;; Otherwise, the function updates the `count` hash table, calculates the maximum frequency of any number in the current window, and checks if the window size minus the max frequency is greater than `k`. 
;; If it is, the function adjusts the count and moves the `left` pointer. Otherwise, it expands the window by moving the `right` pointer and updates `max-length` if necessary.
