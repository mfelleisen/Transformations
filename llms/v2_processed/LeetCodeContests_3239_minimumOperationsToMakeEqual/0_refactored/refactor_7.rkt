;; You are given two positive integers x and y.
;; In one operation, you can do one of the four following operations:
;; Divide x by 11 if x is a multiple of 11.
;; Divide x by 5 if x is a multiple of 5.
;; Decrement x by 1.
;; Increment x by 1.
;; Return the minimum number of operations required to make  x and y equal.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: x = 26, y = 1
;; Output: 3
;; Explanation: We can make 26 equal to 1 by applying the following operations: 
;; 1. Decrement x by 1
;; 2. Divide x by 5
;; 3. Divide x by 5
;; It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of operations required to make 26 equal to 1.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: x = 54, y = 2
;; Output: 4
;; Explanation: We can make 54 equal to 2 by applying the following operations: 
;; 1. Increment x by 1
;; 2. Divide x by 11 
;; 3. Divide x by 5
;; 4. Increment x by 1
;; It can be shown that 4 is the minimum number of operations required to make 54 equal to 2.
;; Example 3:
;; Input: x = 25, y = 30
;; Output: 5
;; Explanation: We can make 25 equal to 30 by applying the following operations: 
;; 1. Increment x by 1
;; 2. Increment x by 1
;; 3. Increment x by 1
;; 4. Increment x by 1
;; 5. Increment x by 1
;; It can be shown that 5 is the minimum number of operations required to make 25 equal to 30.
;; Constraints:
;; 1 <= x, y <= 104
