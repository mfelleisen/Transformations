;; You are given two integers, num and t.
;; An integer x is called achievable if it can become equal to num after applying the following operation no more than t times:
;;  * Increase or decrease x by 1, and simultaneously increase or decrease num by 1.
;; Return the maximum possible achievable number. It can be proven that there exists at least one achievable number.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: num = 4, t = 1
;; Output: 6
;; Explanation: The maximum achievable number is x = 6; it can become equal to num after performing this operation:
;; 1- Decrease x by 1, and increase num by 1. Now, x = 5 and num = 5.
;; It can be proven that there is no achievable number larger than 6.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: num = 3, t = 2
;; Output: 7
;; Explanation: The maximum achievable number is x = 7; after performing these operations, x will equal num:
;; 1- Decrease x by 1, and increase num by 1. Now, x = 6 and num = 4.
;; 2- Decrease x by 1, and increase num by 1. Now, x = 5 and num = 5.
;; It can be proven that there is no achievable number larger than 7.
;; Constraints:
;;  * 1 <= num, tÂ <= 50
(define (theMaximumAchievableX num t)
  ;; The maximum achievable x is calculated as `num + 2 * t`,
  ;; since each operation allows x to diverge by 1 while num compensates by 1 in the opposite direction.

;; Example 1:
;; Input: num = 4, t = 1
;; Output: 6
;; Explanation: The maximum achievable number is x = 6; it can become equal to num after performing this operation:
;; 1- Decrease x by 1, and increase num by 1. Now, x = 5 and num = 5.
;; It can be proven that there is no achievable number larger than 6.
