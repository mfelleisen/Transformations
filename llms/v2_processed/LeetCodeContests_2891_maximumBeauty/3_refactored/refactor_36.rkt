;; You are given a 0-indexed array nums and a non-negative integer k.
;; In one operation, you can do the following:
;;  * Choose an index i that hasn't been chosen before from the range [0, nums.length - 1].
;;  * Replace nums[i] with any integer from the range [nums[i] - k, nums[i] + k].
;; The beauty of the array is the length of the longest subsequence consisting of equal elements.
;; Return the maximum possible beauty of the array nums after applying the operation any number of times.
;; Note that you can apply the operation to each index only once.
;; AÂ subsequence of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the order of the remaining elements.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: nums = [4,6,1,2], k = 2
;; Output: 3
;; Explanation: In this example, we apply the following operations:
;; - Choose index 1, replace it with 4 (from range [4,8]), nums = [4,4,1,2].
;; - Choose index 3, replace it with 4 (from range [0,4]), nums = [4,4,1,4].
;; After the applied operations, the beauty of the array nums is 3 (subsequence consisting of indices 0, 1, and 3).
;; It can be proven that 3 is the maximum possible length we can achieve.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: nums = [1,1,1,1], k = 10
;; Output: 4
;; Explanation: In this example we don't have to apply any operations.
;; The beauty of the array nums is 4 (whole array).
;; Constraints:
;;  * 1 <= nums.length <= 105
;;  * 0 <= nums[i], k <= 105
(define (maximumBeauty nums k)
  ;; Use a hash table to count frequencies of each potential target value
  (define freq-map (make-hash))

  ;; Helper function to update the frequency map for a given number within the range [num-k, num+k]
  (define (update-freq num)
    (for ([possible-value (in-range (- num k) (+ num k 1))])
      (hash-update! freq-map possible-value add1 0)))

  ;; Populate the frequency map by iterating over each number in nums
  (for-each update-freq nums)

  ;; Return the maximum frequency found in the map
  (apply max (hash-values freq-map)))

;; Example usage
(maximumBeauty '(4 6 1 2) 2)  ; Output: 3
(maximumBeauty '(1 1 1 1) 10) ; Output: 4
