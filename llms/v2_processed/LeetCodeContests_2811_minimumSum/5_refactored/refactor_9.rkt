;; You are given two integers,Â n and k.
;; An array of distinct positive integers is called a k-avoiding array if there does not exist any pair of distinct elements that sum to k.
;; Return the minimum possible sum of a k-avoiding array of length n.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: n = 5, k = 4
;; Output: 18
;; Explanation: Consider the k-avoiding array [1,2,4,5,6], which has a sum of 18.
;; It can be proven that there is no k-avoiding array with a sum less than 18.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: n = 2, k = 6
;; Output: 3
;; Explanation: We can construct the array [1,2], which has a sum of 3.
;; It can be proven that there is no k-avoiding array with a sum less than 3.
;; Constraints:
;;  * 1 <= n, k <= 50
(define (minimumSum n k)
  ;; Helper function to check if adding a number violates the k-avoiding property.
  (define (violates? used num k)
    (set-member? used (- k num)))
  
  ;; Recursive function to build the k-avoiding array.
  (define (find-min-sum count current used sum)
    (cond
      [(= count n) sum]  ; If we've added enough elements, return the sum.
      [(or (violates? used current k) (set-member? used current))
       (find-min-sum count (+ current 1) used sum)]  ; Skip current if it violates the condition or is already used.
      [else
       (find-min-sum (+ count 1) (+ current 1) (set-add used current) (+ sum current))]))  ; Otherwise, add it and continue.
  
  ;; Initial call to the recursive function.
  (find-min-sum 0 1 (set) 0))

;; The function `minimumSum` is now defined and can be used to calculate the minimum possible sum of a k-avoiding array of length n.
