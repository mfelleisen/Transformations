;; Define the function minimumSum that takes two integers n and k
;; You are given two integers,Â n and k.
;; An array of distinct positive integers is called a k-avoiding array if there does not exist any pair of distinct elements that sum to k.
;; Return the minimum possible sum of a k-avoiding array of length n.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: n = 5, k = 4
;; Output: 18
;; Explanation: Consider the k-avoiding array [1,2,4,5,6], which has a sum of 18.
;; It can be proven that there is no k-avoiding array with a sum less than 18.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: n = 2, k = 6
;; Output: 3
;; Explanation: We can construct the array [1,2], which has a sum of 3.
;; It can be proven that there is no k-avoiding array with a sum less than 3.
;; Constraints:
;;  * 1 <= n, k <= 50

;; Example usage:
(minimumSum 5 4)  ;; Output: 18
(minimumSum 2 6)  ;; Output: 3
