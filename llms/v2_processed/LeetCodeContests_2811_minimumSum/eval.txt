LOW

The helper function `find-seq` uses a list accumulator that should be a
number. The helper unnecessarily accumulates a sequence of numbers, and then doubly
unnecessarily reverses, and eventually adds all its elements. Secondarily,
the helper `sum-seq' is using `for/sum' in a very simple way that can be
replaced with `(apply + seq)'.
