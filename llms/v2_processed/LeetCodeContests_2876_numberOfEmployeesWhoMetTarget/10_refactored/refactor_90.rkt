;; There are n employees in a company, numbered from 0 to n - 1. Each employee i has worked for hours[i] hours in the company.
;; The company requires each employee to work for at least target hours.
;; You are given a 0-indexed array of non-negative integers hours of length n and a non-negative integer target.
;; Return the integer denoting the number of employees who worked at least target hours.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: hours = [0,1,2,3,4], target = 2
;; Output: 3
;; Explanation: The company wants each employee to work for at least 2 hours.
;; - Employee 0 worked for 0 hours and didn't meet the target.
;; - Employee 1 worked for 1 hours and didn't meet the target.
;; - Employee 2 worked for 2 hours and met the target.
;; - Employee 3 worked for 3 hours and met the target.
;; - Employee 4 worked for 4 hours and met the target.
;; There are 3 employees who met the target.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: hours = [5,1,4,2,2], target = 6
;; Output: 0
;; Explanation: The company wants each employee to work for at least 6 hours.
;; There are 0 employees who met the target.
;; Constraints:
;;  * 1 <= n == hours.length <= 50
;;  * 0 <=Â hours[i], target <= 105
