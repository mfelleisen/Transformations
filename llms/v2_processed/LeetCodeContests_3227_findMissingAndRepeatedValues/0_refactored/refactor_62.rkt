;; Function to find the repeated and missing numbers in a n*n grid.
;; You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer matrix grid of size n * n with values in the range [1, n2]. Each integer appears exactly once except a which appears twice and b which is missing. The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers a and b.
;; Return a 0-indexed integer array ans of size 2 where ans[0] equals to a and ans[1] equals to b.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: grid = [[1,3],[2,2]]
;; Output: [2,4]
;; Explanation: Number 2 is repeated and number 4 is missing so the answer is [2,4].
;; Example 2:
;; Input: grid = [[9,1,7],[8,9,2],[3,4,6]]
;; Output: [9,5]
;; Explanation: Number 9 is repeated and number 5 is missing so the answer is [9,5].
;; Constraints:
;; 2 <= n == grid.length == grid[i].length <= 50
;; 1 <= grid[i][j] <= n * n
;; For all x that 1 <= x <= n * n there is exactly one x that is not equal to any of the grid members.
;; For all x that 1 <= x <= n * n there is exactly one x that is equal to exactly two of the grid members.
;; For all x that 1 <= x <= n * n except two of them there is exatly one pair of i, j that 0 <= i, j <= n - 1 and grid[i][j] == x.
