;; You are given a 2D 0-indexed integer array dimensions.
;; For all indices i, 0 <= i < dimensions.length, dimensions[i][0] represents the length and dimensions[i][1] represents the width of the rectangle i.
;; Return the area of the rectangle having the longest diagonal. If there are multiple rectangles with the longest diagonal, return the area of the rectangle having the maximum area.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: dimensions = [[9,3],[8,6]]
;; Output: 48
;; Explanation: 
;; For index = 0, length = 9 and width = 3. Diagonal length = sqrt(9 * 9 + 3 * 3) = sqrt(90) â‰ˆ 9.487.
;; For index = 1, length = 8 and width = 6. Diagonal length = sqrt(8 * 8 + 6 * 6) = sqrt(100) = 10.
;; So, the rectangle at index 1 has a greater diagonal length therefore we return area = 8 * 6 = 48.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: dimensions = [[3,4],[4,3]]
;; Output: 12
;; Explanation: Length of diagonal is the same for both which is 5, so maximum area = 12.
;; Constraints:
;; 1 <= dimensions.length <= 100
;; dimensions[i].length == 2
;; 1 <= dimensions[i][0], dimensions[i][1] <= 100
