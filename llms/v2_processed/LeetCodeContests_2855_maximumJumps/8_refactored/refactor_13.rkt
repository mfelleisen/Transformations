;; Define the function maximumJumps that calculates the maximum number of jumps
;; from the start to the end of the list nums, with the jump condition based on the target.
;; You are given a 0-indexed array nums of n integers and an integer target.
;; You are initially positioned at index 0. In one step, you can jump from index i to any index j such that:
;;  * 0 <= i < j < n
;;  * -target <= nums[j] - nums[i] <= target
;; Return the maximum number of jumps you can make to reach index n - 1.
;; If there is no way to reach index n - 1, return -1.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: nums = [1,3,6,4,1,2], target = 2
;; Output: 3
;; Explanation: To go from index 0 to index n - 1 with the maximum number of jumps, you can perform the following jumping sequence:
;; - Jump from index 0 to index 1.
;; - Jump from index 1 to index 3.
;; - Jump from index 3 to index 5.
;; It can be proven that there is no other jumping sequence that goes from 0 to n - 1 with more than 3 jumps. Hence, the answer is 3.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: nums = [1,3,6,4,1,2], target = 3
;; Output: 5
;; Explanation: To go from index 0 to index n - 1 with the maximum number of jumps, you can perform the following jumping sequence:
;; - Jump from index 0 to index 1.
;; - Jump from index 1 to index 2.
;; - Jump from index 2 to index 3.
;; - Jump from index 3 to index 4.
;; - Jump from index 4 to index 5.
;; It can be proven that there is no other jumping sequence that goes from 0 to n - 1 with more than 5 jumps. Hence, the answer is 5.
;; Example 3:
;; Input: nums = [1,3,6,4,1,2], target = 0
;; Output: -1
;; Explanation: It can be proven that there is no jumping sequence that goes from 0 to n - 1. Hence, the answer is -1.
;; Constraints:
;;  * 2 <= nums.length == n <= 1000
;;  * -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
;;  * 0 <= target <= 2 * 109

;; Example usage:
(maximumJumps '(1 3 6 4 1 2) 2)  ;; Output: 3
(maximumJumps '(1 3 6 4 1 2) 3)  ;; Output: 5
(maximumJumps '(1 3 6 4 1 2) 0)  ;; Output: -1
