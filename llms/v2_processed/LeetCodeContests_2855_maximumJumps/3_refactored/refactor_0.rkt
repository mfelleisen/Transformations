;; Function to calculate the maximum number of jumps to reach the last index of the list
;; You are given a 0-indexed array nums of n integers and an integer target.
;; You are initially positioned at index 0. In one step, you can jump from index i to any index j such that:
;;  * 0 <= i < j < n
;;  * -target <= nums[j] - nums[i] <= target
;; Return the maximum number of jumps you can make to reach index n - 1.
;; If there is no way to reach index n - 1, return -1.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: nums = [1,3,6,4,1,2], target = 2
;; Output: 3
;; Explanation: To go from index 0 to index n - 1 with the maximum number of jumps, you can perform the following jumping sequence:
;; - Jump from index 0 to index 1.
;; - Jump from index 1 to index 3.
;; - Jump from index 3 to index 5.
;; It can be proven that there is no other jumping sequence that goes from 0 to n - 1 with more than 3 jumps. Hence, the answer is 3.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: nums = [1,3,6,4,1,2], target = 3
;; Output: 5
;; Explanation: To go from index 0 to index n - 1 with the maximum number of jumps, you can perform the following jumping sequence:
;; - Jump from index 0 to index 1.
;; - Jump from index 1 to index 2.
;; - Jump from index 2 to index 3.
;; - Jump from index 3 to index 4.
;; - Jump from index 4 to index 5.
;; It can be proven that there is no other jumping sequence that goes from 0 to n - 1 with more than 5 jumps. Hence, the answer is 5.
;; Example 3:
;; Input: nums = [1,3,6,4,1,2], target = 0
;; Output: -1
;; Explanation: It can be proven that there is no jumping sequence that goes from 0 to n - 1. Hence, the answer is -1.
;; Constraints:
;;  * 2 <= nums.length == n <= 1000
;;  * -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
;;  * 0 <= target <= 2 * 109

              (list-set dp j (max (list-ref dp j) (+ 1 (list-ref dp i))))
              dp))))
  
  ;; Initialize the dp list with negative infinity except the first element set to 0
  (define dp (cons 0 (make-list (- n 1) -inf.0)))
  
  ;; Fold over the range from 0 to n to update dp for each index
  (define final-dp (for/fold ([dp dp]) ([i (in-range n)]) (update-dp i dp)))
  
  ;; Check the last element of dp; if it's still -inf, return -1, otherwise return the value
  (if (= (last final-dp) -inf.0)
      -1
      (last final-dp)))

;; Example usage:
(maximumJumps '(1 3 6 4 1 2) 2)  ; Output: 3
(maximumJumps '(1 3 6 4 1 2) 3)  ; Output: 5
(maximumJumps '(1 3 6 4 1 2) 0)  ; Output: -1
