;; You are given an integer n representing the number of houses on a number line, numbered from 0 to n - 1.
;; Additionally, you are given a 2D integer array offers where offers[i] = [starti, endi, goldi], indicating that ith buyer wants to buy all the houses from starti to endi for goldi amount of gold.
;; As a salesman, your goal is to maximize your earnings by strategically selecting and selling houses to buyers.
;; Return the maximum amount of gold you can earn.
;; Note that different buyers can't buy the same house, and some houses may remain unsold.
;; Example 1:
;; Input: n = 5, offers = [[0,0,1],[0,2,2],[1,3,2]]
;; Output: 3
;; Explanation: There are 5 houses numbered from 0 to 4 and there are 3 purchase offers.
;; We sell houses in the range [0,0] to 1st buyer for 1 gold and houses in the range [1,3] to 3rd buyer for 2 golds.
;; It can be proven that 3 is the maximum amount of gold we can achieve.
;; Example 2:
;; Input: n = 5, offers = [[0,0,1],[0,2,10],[1,3,2]]
;; Output: 10
;; Explanation: There are 5 houses numbered from 0 to 4 and there are 3 purchase offers.
;; We sell houses in the range [0,2] to 2nd buyer for 10 golds.
;; It can be proven that 10 is the maximum amount of gold we can achieve.
;; Constraints:
;;  * 1 <= n <= 105
;;  * 1 <= offers.length <= 105
;;  * offers[i].length == 3
;;  * 0 <= starti <= endi <= n - 1
;;  * 1 <= goldi <= 103
